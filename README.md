## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

This was a great challenge for me. It was the most JavaScript-heavy project I've made so far, which was really good for my vanilla JS skills. I had to come up with a variety of functions for the many functionalities of the challenge, and that made me have to search for other peoples codes online and to come up with my own solutions too.

It was the first project I did with light/dark themes, so I came up with my own strategy for changing the styles, which I'm not sure is the best one possible, so I intend to research about this topic in future projects.

Overall, I really liked doing this and look forward for the next one.
